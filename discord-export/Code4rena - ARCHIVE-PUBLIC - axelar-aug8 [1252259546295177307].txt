``` InterchainTokenExecutable.sol ```  &  ``` InterchainTokenExpressExecutable.sol```  are abstract but no contract inherits them


[08/09/2024 19:10] ebok21
these contracts are supposed to be inherited by the client protocols that want to implement the interchain token transfer functionality


[08/09/2024 19:21] uaarrr
can you explain more what this means or where in docs i can read to understand ?


[08/09/2024 19:24] ebok21
this basically means that the users (protocols) looking to implement custom logic for interchain interactions must inherit this contract

no, testcases are not in the scope. you can refer to Scope Section in the readme: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-axelar-network/blob/main/README.md#scope


[08/10/2024 02:08] ahramy
you can find it from Axelar Scan - Chains, search for zksync. https://axelarscan.io/resources/chains


[08/10/2024 02:11] ahramy
zksync is not supported as of today, I'm not sure Axelar will support zksync or not. Please check out the official Discord channel or community Forum (https://community.axelar.network/)


[08/10/2024 04:33] entangled_qubit
zkSync uses a different create2 derivation mechanism, so it would require some changes in the ITS token deployment to work as expected. And Axelar hasn't added zkSync yet as mentioned above


[08/10/2024 04:38] entangled_qubit
You can see an example flow with an ITS executable here
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-axelar-network/blob/main/interchain-token-service/test/InterchainTokenServiceFullFlow.js#L578


[08/10/2024 04:45] entangled_qubit
FYI You can test out the older ITS v1.2.4 release that's live in production via this UI. This version didn't have the ITS hub support, or gateway token support.

interchain-token-service/contracts/InterchainTokenService.sol 565 LOC but in reality it has over 1200, what does that mean?

please refer to the message flow diagram from this tech spec: https://bright-ambert-2bd.notion.site/ITS-Token-Hub-External-dd30ee912d1e48e683d9488acf75e350
ITS hub is used to route ITS calls via it specifically. When it receives a GMP call (via axelarnet-gateway::Execute), it needs to ensure it is actually an ITS call, i.e it came from the trusted ITS edge contract on the source chain. This requires whitelisting the ITS addresses from each chain, similar to how each ITS edge contract is whitelisting trusted addresses.

The axelarnet-gateway allows routing message to/from router as the other wasm gateway contract. But it also allows initiating messages to another chain, and executing messages that were received with for apps on Axelar.

is the utility code copied off somewhere or modified from existing code? by utility i mean the contracts in upgradable, libs etc


[08/12/2024 16:22] ahramy
No, utils used found here (https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/tree/main/contracts/utils) and not in scope of the audit (they have been audited before)


[08/12/2024 17:11] 0xsomnus
oh sure but i was more asking out of curiosity i.e was it written from scratch or...?


[08/12/2024 21:27] ahramy
Yeah, mostly written from scratch tailormade to our needs. Open zeppelin’s contract upgradability pattern until their latest release was also not compatible with what we were doing (so we didn’t use some of their utils).

what can be the solution ?


[08/13/2024 17:11] jovemjeune
Did you face with any error when you submitted  `cargo build`  on the terminal because now, `cargo test` works without any error for me  but I actually got an error when I first submitted  `cargo build` and the tests hadn't passed until fixing it. I feel like some of the dependencies are not correctly built in your computer but I'm not sure about it.

`cargo test` and `cargo build` work without errors in this directory 
```

but all the errors show up when executing those commands here : 
```

```


[08/13/2024 18:22] jovemjeune
Do you get another error when you try executing that commands at axelarnet-gateway or this is the only error show up on your terminal?Could you share the output of cargo build in case another error shows up? The solutions I found on the internet are not related that's why I ask for further information on bug but it is not consisting because of the path itself I tested that commands there as well.


[08/13/2024 18:28] castle_chain
There are  58 errors show up when calling `cargo build` all about trait bounds and trait implementations so I think the package has something wrong .

Is it will deployed in every chain which is in Axelarscan ?


[08/14/2024 16:33] villy9172
Are the project files in scope currently deployed on mainnet?


[08/14/2024 20:15] 0xsomnus
@ahramy just to confirm, the expected behaviour is that you should be able to call any contract on another chain via axelar and as long as it implements the sdk, it should be called, yes?


[08/14/2024 22:54] ahramy (pinned)
There are multiple components in Axelar. Please refer to tech spec https://bright-ambert-2bd.notion.site/ITS-Token-Hub-External-dd30ee912d1e48e683d9488acf75e350 for the audit.

A valid proof is still required to be passed in. So all the operator can do is bypass the rotation delay. The operator can be overwritten by the owner (governance contract). In case of a compromise of one of the recent signer sets, the honest signers can coordinate with the operator to rotate out the malicious signer set.

Does the normal constructor get called when using "create3" deployment method??


[08/22/2024 12:02] sp1cymeatball
@ahramy hey! Does ITS contract supposed to hold any tokens on it's balance?


[08/22/2024 14:08] petro_1912
Started a thread.


[08/22/2024 17:43] ahramy
Yep, create3 makes it so the address is derived only based on the sender address and salt, and NOT the bytecode. Constructor is still called normally. This allows interchain tokens (and token managers) on different evm chains to have the same token address if they use the same tokenId.


[08/22/2024 17:46] ahramy
ITS is not meant to hold any tokens or ETH. It collects and sends them out immediately.

The token deployer doesn’t need to be trusted if it’s deployed as a canonical ITS token. The minter role needs to be trusted if one is set. ITS factory allows the token deployer to set no minter. Furthermore, ITS factory prevents the token deployer from changing the token configuration for future deployments (token symbol, decimals etc.). Hence, tokens deployed via the ITS factory can be trusted more than the flexible deployments from ITS contract. Please provide more context if your question is still unresolved.

the tab was open whilst the machine was either sleep or something, and the time change didn't reflect on the tab 😦 sorry to hear bro. you can always report the bug on a different platform (i think) i can see they are on a different one but i won't mention in case it is against code4rena rules


[08/26/2024 20:28] mansa11
Thanks man.
I’ll look into that

I'm sorry to hear that you missed the submission deadline! Extensions dont happen often but if it needs to happen, we'd announce it here in the audit channel.

actually extension is not a bad idea, especially because it seems that Rust part is not really functioning according to the docs


[08/27/2024 03:50] kirill_taran
by the way, just curious -- how exactly `axelarnet-gateway` is connected to verifiers? it only communicates with `router` and other gateway by generic API. my understanding is that verification is done by source/destination in case of EVM-chains, but for non-EVM chains I don't see that `verifier`, `multisig`, `prover` modules are called by `axelarnet-gateway`. are these used implicitly by relayers? docs don't cover that, in fact relaying and so much of the system is out of scope, I think the scope numbers are pretty misleading. participants who never worked with Axelar before have to read at least 3 times more code than the actual scope.
