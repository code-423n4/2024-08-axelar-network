Based on Warden suggestion, the @SlingshotCrypto contest will have a side pool of $2,000 USDC for gas optimizations.

If you find a gas optimization, include it in your subsmission for a slice of the side pool!

@SlingshotCrypto excited for the added value!

Expect some updates to the process before the next contest and iteration beyond that. We'll keep you posted!

Hats off to @🔥Mervyn🔥 for the idea! 👏 👏 👏  Going forward, all sponsors can add their own tokens _on top of_ the primary pool based on C4's recommended minimum as a bonus.

What if C4 competitor awards were paid in money (ETH/USDC) AND a sponsor threw in their own tokens as a bonus to sweeten the pot?

@VaderProtocol's brilliant idea. $75k worth of hard-to-get $VETH tokens added on top of their 27 ETH pot

Hey, y'all. We've definitely learned the past couple months that the steady cadence of our contests will require a stable team so we can do things like line up @🏛Judges in advance and get @🐺Wardenss paid and not have me somehow inevitably screw up the start/stop timecodes on every contest 😂  

So I'm excited to say you're gonna start seeing some other folks helping organizing contests, if you haven't already. I want to introduce you to @🦖 eric (ninek) | C4, @🧺 picnic, @Jay | C4, and @CloudEllie - AWAY 'til 4 Nov. 

You'll also start seeing some contributions from @🚀 dstaley | C4 and a couple other folks soon making improvements to the site and our contest tooling for submissions and judging.

Big thanks :thankyou:  to everyone who weighed in about the proposed improvements to our Discord server -- your feedback has been integrated and we've implemented the proposed changes. (The full list of changes, and related discussion, is over here on the C4 forum: https://forum.code4rena.com/t/rfc-proposed-discord-improvements/19/9.)

This means that going forward, if you invite friends to this server, they'll need to agree to our community rules, which are posted in the #👉start-here channel. This is an awesome community and we want to keep it that way. 

We definitely welcome further suggestions for improvements -- feel free to tag @🧑🏽‍⚖️moderators with any ideas or feedback!

Hey all!  👋

💡*Reminder: the C4 team is off tomorrow (June 18) for the US **Juneteenth** holiday.*

That means you get your weekly **C4 Rollup** one day early! 😉 

**🗓 Upcoming Contests**

Note: For upcoming contests, you might start seeing a new term: **"preview week"**.  During a preview week, the repo and documentation are available to view, and some sponsors add walkthroughs and answer questions. (Submissions are not accepted until the contest officially opens.)

We are adding this as an option for sponsors specifically based on balancing feedback from wardens who'd like a little more time to get familiar with a codebase before a competition, while others have preferred the time-constrained approach for the contest.  We have gotten so much value out of our conversations with the community and your continued input is playing a central role in our work.  Thank you.  

- 🏆 Tracer, $80,000 USDC. Starts 6/24.

- 🏆 Gro Protocol, $100,000.  Preview week starts 6/24 (see note above). You can submit findings starting on 7/1.

- Actively lining up audits for July and August. Stay tuned...

** 💻  Contest Updates**

- ⭐️ Active: **PoolTogether** (Repo: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-pooltogether), **Reality Cards **(in sponsor review) 

- 🏁 Completed: 88mph (Report: https://code423n4.com/reports/2021-05-88mph/)

- 📓 Reporting: NFTX, Vader

- 💸 Awarding: **Meebits** (Award list: https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810936719003090974/854500235643715624), **Fairside** (Award list: https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810936719003090974/855183633547395082)

**🗞 C4 Rollup**

Happy 5 month-anniversary, wolfpack! 🎉  We've done some incredible things together in that time. Just check out the stats in this tweet thread: https://twitter.com/code423n4/status/1416122123513335808

And there is even more to come. Can you imagine the next 5 months?  We can't wait!  Here are some conversations you may have missed:

- In #😃・chat, wardens and the C4 team share thoughts on being a smart contract auditing beginner and building skills. Join the conversation!

- @Gerard Persoon is looking for @🐺Wardens to help him build a library of smart contract vulnerabilities: https://forum.code4rena.com/t/library-of-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-and-patterns/50. You in?

- While discussing some process updates, we were big fans of this Go! Fight! Win! message from @sock: "Deprecate! Prune! Move forward into the bright new dawn of documentation with boldness and impunity!" 💪  Can we get a howl?  🐺

- Speaking of documentation, we added the language for 'bug bounties' vs. 'audit contests to our project docs: https://docs.code4rena.com

Our #📢・c4-updates channel blew up this week, especially on Wednesday, because we had so many good things to share! 🎉 A mid-week contest update, a familiar face came back for a micro contest, and we hosted our first community call (complete with a POAP badge)!

But wait, there's more...

🔥  @CloudEllie - AWAY 'til 4 Nov added a new interview to **The Ones in the Arena** series.  Learn more about Float Capital, their synthetic asset protocol, and why they bring a chess set on their trips: https://medium.com/code-423n4/the-ones-in-the-arena-float-capital-41ac3c372e97 ♟️ 

🔥  Overheard on a team call: "When was the last time you felt combobulated?" (in response to an "I feel discombobulated" statement).  When indeed? 🤔 

🔥  @🐯 Tiger | C4, @🍔 Burgertime | C4, @jaime are hard at work thinking through brand identity and strategy for C4 in addition to creating fun, wolfy artwork for our contests. Give 'em a howl. :hi5: 

🔥  @sock brought home a cat.  On a T-shirt. https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/855206418301714453/869360185116872744 🐱

**The C4 world is expanding!**

Based on how smashingly C4’s model has worked in the eth (and evm compatible) world, we’re opening up the approach to other chains.

First up: **Cosmos.** We’re going to soon be making some big public announcements, including a $100k USDC (+ tokens) contest to audit the Cosmos Gravity Bridge. Given Cosmos is its own blockchain universe with a completely different language and its own uniqueness, this will be an **entirely new C4 league**.

We’ll be pushing out the word to recruit Cosmos-focused wardens in kicking off this new league’s first contest, and opening up the opportunity for other Cosmos sponsors as well.

You’ll notice we've made a couple minor tweaks to channels in discord—specifically two new categories, one for our **Ethereum League**, and one for our **Cosmos League**. 

Each contest will now have its own channel for questions, code walkthroughs, and you'll be able to see the dates for scheduled contests in each of the leagues right in the name of the channel.

🏆  🎉 **$390,000 in awards just went out!**

Several new @🐺Wardens    who’ve joined us recently should have just received their first healthy payouts! 🙂 Thanks to painstaking effort by @loudog  and @🦖 eric (ninek) | C4, we’ve been able to do a ton of catchup on award payments.

**Faster payouts coming**
Our goal is to consistently get awards out within two weeks of contest end. We’re not there yet, but we have made some shifts which should help us start to see roughly that cadence:

1. @loudog  has taken on responsibility for lining up judges and has been streamlining our approach there.

2. @🚀 dstaley | C4  is diving into building a more seamless process for judging and awardcalc tools to account for some of the onerous data validation work that has caused slowdowns in the past.

3. Going forward, **we are going to switch to sending awards out on Polygon**, which should speed up the onerous work of approving and executing transactions in Gnosis AND keep us from having to time our payments in between NFT mints to avoid paying out the ear for gas.

_ (Note there’s 5 transactions in need of one last round of multisig approvals, but expecting those to be wrapped by tomorrow morning at the latest)_

**🗞 C4 Rollup**

It has been a busy week for @CloudEllie - AWAY 'til 4 Nov interviewing sponsors for **The Ones in the Arena** series.  ICYMI:

Read up on PoolTogether's CTO and co-founder @Brendan 🌊🏆's thoughts on what makes for a successful protocol (we’re big fans of his approach): https://medium.com/code-423n4/the-ones-in-the-arena-pooltogether-e1452ab7451a

A discussion with Tempus Finance co-founders @mijovic and @garai about the future of fixed-rate lending/staking in DeFi: https://medium.com/code-423n4/the-ones-in-the-arena-tempus-finance-13f928854c5d

One of our favorite quotes from Covalent's Q&A: https://medium.com/code-423n4/the-ones-in-the-arena-covalent-33fd412ce8f4
> “The composability of DeFi astounds me. You see novel applications being built on top of one another, completely accelerating the rate of innovation. This makes security even more important…if there is a failure on a lower layer it will have a cascading effect.”

🐺 **New logo, new name, and site updates! 🎉**

Out: Code423n4
In: **Code4rena**

We still :cyberheart: 1337, but tbh this is a whole lot easier to remember, spell, and type 😂. The site will be at **code4rena.com** and our twitter handle is now **@code4rena**.

We also rolled out some website improvements! 💻✨ 

Check them out at https://code4rena.com

Biggest update is that each contest now has its very own page on the site, with all the info you need to compete (including the contest readme)

There’s a lot of other little tweaks and enhancements, too.

Keep the ideas and feedback coming 🙂

**🗞 C4 Rollup**

⏳  If you're a warden who wants to become a C4 judge, applications close tonight at 23:59 UTC (in about 3 hours!).  Details here:  https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/judges

Need a bug-finding/judging/sponsoring break?  @🍔 Burgertime | C4 keeps our #🌀・awesome-nonsense channel awesome (*see what we did there?*).  There is a dog reindeer if you are feeling the holiday spirit, tweets that have us saying "same" in our heads, and an opportunity to dust off an old domain to raise money for charity.

[12/13/2021 19:28] sockdrawermoney
@everyone As many of you know, Code4rena is turning our informal open organization into a token-governed DAO.

You were included in the December 10 snapshot for those eligible for the imminent airdrop of Code4rena's valueless governance token if you:

—received any awards prior to December 10 and are still a warden in good standing
—judged any contests which distributed awards prior to December 10
—sponsored a contest whose awards were distributed prior to December 10 (specifically if you were the initiator(s) of the engagement)
—served as a very early volunteer organizer
—bootstrapped C4 into reality

In order to receive the airdrop, you MUST:

—meet the eligibility described above
—be a member of this discord
—complete a form with an email and a Polygon address
—agree to the token grant agreement that will be sent to the provided email address

To prevent fraudulent submissions, you will be assigned a unique identifier via DM which must be submitted with your information.

**Please either turn on DMs from C4 server members OR add @Jay | C4 @🦖 eric (ninek) | C4 @CloudEllie - AWAY 'til 4 Nov @sock as friends so we can DM you your identifier and a link to the form, which simply requests a Polygon address and your email.**

**Please complete the form by Wednesday 16:00 UTC, then sign the token grant agreement within 24 hours of receiving it via email.**

**Why do we need an email? **
We have a simple token grant agreement for you to sign which will be emailed to you from Code4rena's attorney. We will not use your email address for any other reason.

PS Thank you to @hickuphh3, @cmichel, @tabish.eth, @Gerard Persoon, @Deleted User, @🚀 dstaley | C4, and @dzhawsh for your behind-the-scenes work getting together our governance and token contracts, tests, airdrop, and claim interface.

The C4 team is going to be starting to send DMs soon. In order to keep their DMs to a minimum amount of chaos 🙂 wardens should first review the snapshot in the #deleted-channel channel and then post a request for help there if you have a question.

Just a little note to say that the token grant agreement emails have _not_ gone out yet. The agreement is still getting some polish—so don't worry about refreshing your email every 5 minutes. As soon as it's ready to go out, I'll drop an update here so you know to be on the lookout 🙂

🌨 **Airdrop Update for @everyone:** 

😅 Working on pulling the last few pieces together.

It will likely be another 24-48 hours before you will have a legal agreement in your inbox, but don't worry: we will ensure you have 24 hours to be able to sign and return the agreement.

Also, while we do not need to collect your name to *send* you the token grant agreement, the attorneys *will* need you to add your name on the contract when you sign it.

Hi, folks! Just a reminder that C4 staff is going on holiday from **now through January 2.**

If you have questions or needs, your best bet (as always) is to **ask in the relevant channel or in #❓・questions**, as it's possible one of the many generous souls hanging around discord may be able to help 🙂

I will definitely be around, but might be slow to respond given juggling a few things.

On the token-launch front, I'm still working with attorneys and our Cayman Foundation folks to push things forward. Hopefully we'll get a target date on the airdrop soon.

On a personal note, I want to say I deeply appreciate the privilege of working with and serving alongside you all in building this special community and getting to be part of the great things you are all making possible for the industry.

@🐺Wardens @🏛Judges @💼Sponsors **You can now claim your $ARENA** at https://tokens.code4rena.com if you were included in the initial airdrop.

If you expected to receive tokens and didn't, please review this troubleshooting guide: https://code4rena.notion.site/Airdrop-troubleshooting-3ddda661b25b4161bb0a7c97dd11d29e

Our opening governance proposal will be live on approximately Jan 18 and will be open until next Wednesday Jan 26. If you wish to participate in that vote, please claim tokens before the January 18 0:00 UTC snapshot.

You can view the proposal in the Code4rena forum: https://forum.code4rena.com/t/c4ip-1-constitution-dao-bootstrapping-reimbursements-token-sale/93. 

There is a lot in this proposal in order to stitch together all the pieces in bootstrapping the various components of the DAO, so don't hesitate to ask if something is unclear. Your questions are most welcome either in the #deleted-channel channel or in the forum discussion itself.

On a personal note, thank you all so much for your patience in this. Definitely my first token launch rodeo and I sure learned a lot! I also want to express huge appreciation for the folks who have carried the ball in big ways through this token launch: @hickuphh3, @cmichel, @tabish.eth, @Gerard Persoon, and everyone else who participated in getting things this far.

Also, in #🙌・high-fives this week, @sock shared some awesome news: “in the last 50 contests, there's only been **ONE** contest without wardens finding at least one high severity vulnerability.” :hi5:

Hey @🐺Wardens @🏛Judges @💼Sponsors! If you're not following along in #deleted-channel, here's your heads up that **our opening five governance proposals are live until Wednesday**. 

We'd love to see a high vote turnout for these. Nice chance to try out those brand new governance tokens. 🙂 https://alpha.withtally.com/governance/eip155:137:0xc6eaDcC36aFcf1C430962506ad79145aD5140E58

@🏆Leaderboard wardens, an update: we discovered after running our award calculations for the  **Streaming** contest that we had accidentally mis-labelled four gas optimization findings as duplicates. We have re-run the award calculations, but rather than adjusting everyone's payouts, we are simply going to: 

- Pay out the higher of the two resulting values (meaning, no one will receive less than the originally announced awards, but the four wardens whose submissions were mis-labelled will receive slightly more than originally announced), and 

- Update the leaderboard to reflect the correct values. 

Therefore, you may notice some minor differences between the actual amounts you receive from Code4rena and what's shown on the leaderboard. 

In all cases, the difference is $105 or less, and for wardens who did not submit gas optimizations you should see no difference at all.

@everyone **Important C4 mechanism update!**

👉 **QA REPORTS (low/non-critical)** 
Starting with contests kicking off this week, low and non-critical findings will now be submitted as a *SINGLE* QA Report. We are allocating a **fixed 10% of prize pools toward QA Reports**.

Your QA Report should include: 
- a summary statement with observations on the codebase as a whole and opportunities for improved security practices
- all low severity findings
- all non-critical findings

Each QA report will be assessed based on report quality and thoroughness as compared with other reports with awards distributed on a curve. The top QA Report author will have their work included and cited in the final C4 report and receive the top prize from the category.

Wardens overstating the severity of QA issues (submitting low/non-critical issues as med/high in order to angle for higher payouts) will have their scores reduced by judges.

👉 **GAS REPORTS**
We are also going to take the **same approach for the gas optimizations pool:** a single submission per warden which includes all identified optimizations, with the gas pool allocated on a curve and the top reporter’s work included in the C4 report.

❓ **HOW WILL SUBMISSIONS WORK? **
We are working on some updates to submission forms to accommodate these changes. Until then, we will provide documentation in the contest on how to submit QA Reports and Gas Reports via email until those updates are done. 

(High and medium submissions will continue to work the same way they do now.)

Hopefully this will significantly reduce everyone's work and get us all on the same page 🙂 

We expect some wardens will choose to skip the lows and focus on the med/high without fear they’re giving up awards if they don’t compete on lows.

Meanwhile wardens who are newer can put their focus into writing good reports and thinking about the codebase while knowing their QA contributions will be compensated.

[03/15/2022 20:18] cloudellie
@🐺Wardens For those who participated in the **Insure** contest that ran Jan 7-13, a small number of findings were re-assessed by the judge after the awards were announced and distributed. This happens very infrequently, usually due to additional context being provided by the sponsor after judging is complete. (In the weeks since this contest was judged, we have refined our processes to improve QA going forward.)

You can see more details in the report, which is now live on our website -- but the TL;DR is: 

- 1 high risk issue was initially deemed a unique finding, but re-assessed as a duplicate;
- 1 medium-risk issue was re-assessed as invalid;
- a set of 4 non-critical, duplicate issues were upgraded to low risk and grouped with another set of duplicates.

As a result, we have re-run the award calculations, and all wardens who are owed $10 or more will receive an additional payout for this contest. (This is true for 10 wardens.)

If your initial payout was higher than the re-calculated awards, well, enjoy! Maybe tweet something nice about Code4rena. 😁

Note that the leaderboard has been updated to reflect the corrected award amounts.

Looking for any additional feedback/concerns/questions on the RFC for Certified Wardens, Rulebook, Scout role, contest QA, and mitigation review services. 

We generally have heard a positive response to this and we are moving forward with implementation in the absence of paramount concerns.

The only concerns expressed thus far have been:
—whether wardens would be required in the future to get certified in order to participate in all contests _(No, I don't see that happening.)_
—why the all or nothing approach to certification when it comes to the new roles/opportunities _(keep processes simple and avoid an increase to the social engineering attack surface area.)_

@everyone The ‘org’ repo is now the hub for all our community discussions and governance alongside discord.

We have finished moving the community forum from discourse to github, which we did based on input/request from the community.  The ‘rulebook’ issues have moved to the 'org' as well, so we'll be able to keep all of that together.

There’s already a lot of new and interesting activity going on there. Highly recommend turning on ‘watch’ for that repo.

@🐺Wardens **Update about the Li.Fi contest:**

Something unusual happened with Li.Fi’s recent contest, in that the report was published and the findings repo was made public before we got the awards sent out. As a result, a warden reached out to us to point out a concern about the judging. They found 3 reports that they felt the judge had incorrectly downgraded to low/QA rather than judging them as High.

We brought the concern to the judge and he agreed with the warden's assessment that those findings should have been judged as duplicates of finding H-01.

We originally announced the awards on April 20, but since they have not yet been sent, we feel it's appropriate to re-calculate the awards based on the judge's re-assessment.

Due to the way our award math works (see https://docs.code4rena.com/incentive-model-and-awards for an explanation), this means that many wardens’ payouts are affected (mostly for the better!), but we hope you can appreciate the reasoning here; our top priority as always is to ensure fairness and high quality in our contests and our reports.

Going forward, we expect fewer instances like this, especially once we onboard some of y’all as certified wardens and you’ll help us catch them sooner. 🙂

We'll be updating the report, leaderboard, and award announcement shortly.

@🐺Wardens if you just received C4 awards for LiFi (txns in the last 2 hours), can you hold those pls? we discovered an error in the spreadsheet driving the award calc which ended up with us distributing some incorrect awards and mismatched addresses. we'll be sorting this out and we'll have a full post-mortem on it when we are able to.

**LIFI contest awards post-mortem:**

A series of errors led to distributions of awards to the incorrect wallets. This was caused by a findings data sorting mistake and subsequent validation mistakes that occurred as the result of this contest being re-run through the award calculation process a second time, which is an unusual occurrence.

We have reached out to folks individually to remedy and reconcile the amounts that have been sent. In some cases, with approval of the individual, we are reducing the amount of future award payments to accommodate an overpayment; we will be sending additional funds to folks who were underpaid; and in a few cases, we've asked to have the funds returned, many of which have already happened.

To prevent this in the future, we will be improving the UX for how findings data is handled and moved through the post-contest process; we will also build an automated address validation check to identify anomalies; and we will ensure that an additional, manual review of addresses receiving awards is completed for every contest prior to awarding.

We apologize for the inconvenience and mistakes, and we are confident that the additional safeguards we are putting into place will significantly reduce the possibility that this will happen again.

**Update on Backd:**
Since discovering the issue with the Li.Fi awards last week, we've been combing through other recent award calculations and found a (much smaller) error in the Backd awarding. Most of you are getting a little more than initially announced. Since the adjustments are so small, we’ve simply edited our initial announcement and are pushing the change to the leaderboard. Thanks for your understanding!

@🐺Wardens 

1. If you are partway through Provenance's certified warden process and have been lagging, I'd highly recommend completing it! 🙂

2. Eligible to apply to be a certified warden and haven't applied yet? Consider doing that ... like ... now 🙂 

Why? JUST A HUNCH I HAVE THAT IS ALL

@🐺Wardens When the community created the certified warden concept, we weren't expecting this OpenSea contest or the use case they have (public contest, but KYC'd to receive payment because of sponsor constraints).

We're going to change things and make this easier given this context.

1. Everyone who has already joined C4 as of today will be eligible to apply to be a certified warden (which essentially just cover KYC/OFAC screening).

2. We will have a certified+ role that will require folks to also be at a certain performance level within C4 in order to be eligible for other opportunities. If you're already approved as a @📛Certified warden, you'll be upgraded to Certified+ shortly.

As a result of the influx we are likely to see with this OpenSea announcement, new warden registration is **by application only**. 

We will be asking all new folks at warden registration to provide linked evidence of their ability to compete at a high level in an audit contest.

@🐺Wardens 🚨** Open Sea Seaport contest deadline extension - you have 4 more hours** 🚨

We've decided to accept #deleted-channel submissions until 23:59*, to make sure everyone has time to complete their submissions and do their best work.

Should also help any wardens who weren't aware that our contest start/end times changed recently. 🙂 

Good luck and good hunting! 🐺

(* That's 23:59 UTC, translated to your local time zone)

Applications open for a working group creating an **incentivized mentorship** model. Selected participants will be eligible for a retroactive $ARENA token grant.

Perspectives needed:

1. wardens who've found at least 20 high severity issues and who'd be interested in mentoring if it was properly incentivized
2. wardens who have grown immensely during their time competing in C4
3. wardens who are early in their journey AND who have a unique perspective to offer

In all cases, you should have a level of passion about Code4rena being a place for people to learn and grow in their ability to audit smart contracts.

In the interest of keeping the group focused and effective, only a handful of people will be invited to participate.

~~Applications due Friday, June 24 at 20:00 UTC~~
APPLY: https://forms.gle/UKUKHBRbXkveWT2j9

The **C4 Ambassador Program** will be running a pilot test for the month of July.

The premise is simple:
- C4 provide support to help you refer projects more smoothly
- You let projects who need audits know about C4
- C4 pays you 1% of prize pool for any contests you refer

If you're interested in being a part of it (especially if you already have projects in mind that could benefit from C4 services), fill out this form by the end of the week and @obrontwill be in touch on next steps:

GM @🐺Wardens ! 

Wallet auth is now live :C4Keycap: 🐺 🤑 🎉

**Starting today, you can authenticate with your wallet using either MetaMask or WalletConnect and submit findings without re-entering the same info over and over.**

**BUT FIRST!** You need to re-register your warden handle at https://code4rena.com to associate your wallet address with your C4 warden info.

---------

**How to connect your wallet and submit findings**
- Go to https://code4rena.com and click the “connect wallet” link
- **If you have previously submitted valid findings:** use an address you’ve used previously to receive earnings from code4rena contests.
- Follow the prompts to connect your C4 username with your wallet.
- Check your email for further instructions.

**Once your request to connect your wallet is complete and approved:**
- Sign in with MetaMask or WalletConnect
- Proceed to the contest of your choice and submit a finding as usual

**Teams:** once individual team members are authenticated, they will be able to submit findings as individuals or on behalf of the team.

**Questions?** Let us know in #login-and-registration-help

hm @everyone! I was excited to join y'all on the community call today, but I've had a little health adventure today and I've asked @Etherean if we can make the call a _post_-ethcc call instead of a _pre_-ethcc call. 

So: please standby for new day/time of community call. Thanks for understanding.

ℹ️ Heads up: over the next few days, we'll be shifting our language slightly for the "certified" wardens as follows:

- Current "certified" wardens will be referred to as `+certified`

- Current "certified+" wardens will also be given the `+backstage` role, which means they're eligible for early access to findings repos, triage, and post-judging QA.

This is a start on implementing some of the changes Sock proposed back on June 9, here: https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/29

@🐺Wardens 

🐺 :C4Keycap: 📣 Announcing some UX improvements for contest submissions!

**Longer QA and Gas reports are now supported**
Wardens who want to submit large reports no longer need to email them in. We’ve increased the character limit so you can now submit them in the form.

**Only one QA and one gas report per contest is now enforced**
We made it easier to follow the submission guidelines, so you can focus on finding bugs.

**You can now withdraw a finding**
In addition to editing, you can now withdraw findings altogether, e.g. if you accidentally submitted to the wrong contest, or realize your submission is not valid.

*Questions? Please post them in the #❓・questions channel.*

**Formal verification contest trial**

We're working on a collaboration with the folks at **Certora** to offer our first formal verification contest alongside C4 audit contests. The plan is to do one and see what we learn.

Right now we're looking for a project who'd like to get *both* a C4 audit contest and also have formal verification tests created. (Reach out to @Trebien | C4 if that's you or a project you're involved with.)

Certora has some online resources for getting up to speed:

—docs: https://docs.certora.com
—tutorials: https://github.com/Certora/Tutorials
—workshop video: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtu7wuOMP9XHbjAevkw2nL29YMubqEFj

@everyone We just made a MAJOR upgrade to _new_ audit contests that will hugely benefit both @💼Sponsors and @🐺Wardens. 

Contests booked going forward will be triaged and deduped in one week so sponsors don't have to wade through issues AND the contest process doesn't need to await their review to move forward.

This is a big deal. Let's get this a bunch of retweets 🙂

New audit contests get back a triaged list of issues one week after the contest end date. 

Builders can keep building.

**New features: custom payment addresses, alt login method**

@🐺Wardens  2 highly requested features shipped today! 

1. You can now log in to your account with a username/pwd, not just your wallet. 

2. Set a custom payment address to designate the wallet to which you want C4 awards sent.

This means you can now DIY your payment addresses through your C4 user account.
 
🚨  **Important: going forward, payment addresses will not be linked to specific contests. Instead, awards will be sent to whatever payment address you have saved to your account at the time awards are calculated. **

This means that if you lose access to a wallet after submitting it with contest submissions, you only have to log in and update your payment address. :hi5: 💰 🐺

@🐺Wardens  important!  Users with the latest MetaMask extension are seeing phishing warnings from MetaMask when they try to set their passwords. This is caused by Moralis being marked as phishing by Metamask. 

~~Moralis is working on that right now, but the fix will require us to take a few minutes of downtime, **starting now.** ~~

~~ **TL;DR - please back up your work! **And bear with us -- we'll post an update as soon as we have the issue resolved. ~~

**Update:** this issue is now resolved. Thanks for your patience!

[10/14/2022 22:53] sockdrawermoney
Another important update for @🐺Wardens: 

1. Contest channels are professional work spaces shared with sponsors. Conversations should be strictly on-topic and respectful of sponsors, their code, and team. Crossing this line will result in a 24 hour discord server timeout. Repeat offenses will extend future timeouts. 

2. Please don’t DM judges about submissions unless they initiate it or you ask for permission first — it’s simply not sustainable for them to have conversations like this. @🏛Judges will be asked to report unsolicited DMs to C4 staff and folks crossing this line will also be given a 24h server timeout.

Heads up for @🐺Wardens and @🏛Judges: We are going to start listing contest pools slightly differently.

**Note well:** We are **not** changing how we scope contests or award sizes, just transparently providing more detail.

“Total award pool" will now include:
- HM awards
- QA awards
- Gas optz awards
- Judge awards
- Judge presort awards
- Scout/scoping awards
- Mitigation review awards
- etc

These details will be spelled out in the contest’s readme.

We will be considering mitigation reviews a continuation of the original contest pool and thus part of the contest's total award pool, since eligibility for these reviews is based on performance in the original contest.

**Important update on awarding:**

There's been lots of good discussion, analysis, and input on the set of updates to rules and formula announced last week.  (https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/50) Thanks to everyone who participated and provided input.

We’re going to take a half-step back on this.

The full announcement is still in effect with one exception: **we will not be changing the award formula decrementer from 0.9 to 0.6 at this time.**

We’ll see how other changes impact contest outcomes and make further adjustments based on what we learn from contest results following the other rule changes.

Quick update on penalties for @🐺Wardens submitting multiple unsatisfactory items:

We’re going to calculate awards both _with_ penalties and without them for the sake of better understanding how they work in contests after these were announced, but **they will not be applied in contests yet.**

We may enact them at any time, though the threshold may increase to make results less harsh.

So: breathe easy if you’ve been stressing about this. We think there’s value in the _penalties-kicks-in-after-x_ model, but it will likely be less aggressive at the point of implementation.

We are systematizing our discipline process a bit in order to reduce the amount of time and effort from judges and CAs and to create a clearer flow of disciplinary actions.

Rather than the ad hoc and mostly DM-based way that these things are currently communicated, we’re going to move to a simple and formally structured email-based notification process.

This is a draft of definitions and process documentation which can be considered the current active process as of today. These are being shared publicly for community review, questions, and input which may result in changes.

:code4rena: **C4 community data changelog**

C4’s community has built some amazing tools on top of the data available in our public repos. We know a couple of recent file relocations were unexpected, so we thought we’d update you on current status and plans.

TL;DR - we've restored two things that got recently lost in some shuffling, and we’re also preparing you for some similar changes coming in future:

- The Markdown source code files for contest reports that were also in the dotcom repo (under _data/reports) are also now available in each individual contest’s findings repo. Report files are consistently named `./report.md` (e.g. the Tigris report is at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/blob/main/report.md). So if anyone needs to, they should be able to loop through the contests list and predict the new GitHub URL patterns.

- The  `contests.csv` data that was in the https://github.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com repo is now available again at https://code4rena.com/community-resources/contests.csv in the same format.

- The `findings.csv` data that **still is** in the https://github.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com repo is nevertheless *also* available at a new URL https://code4rena.com/community-resources/findings.csv. **Any community members relying on this are encouraged to migrate to this new URL asap**, and stop relying on the now-deprecated original file in GitHub.

Community members should also be aware that:

- Anything else left in the `_data/*` folder(s) of the https://github.com/code-423n4/code423n4.com  repo is likely to go away soon or later. Please don’t rely on it!

- Particularly the `_data/handles/*` and `_data/orgs/*` stuff is not likely to remain public. The plan is to move those into a database and provide new ways of editing the content, at which point account information will *not* be directly available to the public.

Feel free to drop questions in #❓・questions, or ideas in #📥・suggestion-box.

🤖 **First Bot Race Qualifier will be April 12**

Kicks off at the start time of Frankencoin audit. RSVP now open in #✋・rsvp channel to indicate your intent to race a bot in the qualifier!

**Important notes:**

1. Bot Qualifier is not a paid competition but a qualifying race to determine your bot's eligibility for Bot Races. (The first Bot Race will have 20 open slots.)

2. Bot Registration and Bot Report form are the same thing and will be open for one hour.

3. VERY important: **you'll need to be registered as a warden to be part of a Bot Crew**, so if you haven't done that yet, I encourage hopping into #🐺・i-want-to-be-a-warden and starting the process of joining as a warden!

Opening #deleted-channel for any questions

Some changes to pool structures:

1. Bot race pool for Chainlink will be $5,000.

2. Default QA and Gas pools will each be **2.5%** of pools. (QA will remain the fallback if no HMs.)

This change will apply to Chainlink. Expect an update on pools for audits starting next week.

✨ **New: Verify with Discord through your C4 user account**

As Code4rena rolls out more Discord-related automations, we're streamlining the process of connecting your Discord account to your C4 user account. What has until now been a clunky manual process is now a simple, one-time verification step within your C4 user profile. 

By verifying your Discord account, you'll ensure that you continue to be tagged in award announcements and other good-news notifications 🎉

**Steps to verify with Discord:**
1. Using the `Profile` drop down on the top right of the [code4rena.com](https://code4rena.com) website, select "manage account."
2. Under "User Information," you should see an option indicating whether your Discord account has been verified.
3. If you are not yet verified, click the "Verify" link under the "Please verify your Discord user" option; this will redirect you to a Discord authorisation page.
4. On the Discord page, click “Authorize.” You will then be redirected back to code4rena.com/account.
5. If the verification is successful, you will see “✓ Discord verified.”

**Is this required?**
No, but in the coming weeks we'll be rolling out automation for award announcements that will tag users with validated Discord accounts. 

Wardens who don't validate their Discord will be listed in announcements, but not tagged.

✨ **Today's the day: Verify with Discord to be tagged in award announcements**

Huge thanks to the hundreds of C4 community members who have completed the Discord verification process! :hi5::thankyou:  

As I mentioned in [my Aug 21 post](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1146836596465872916), we're updating our processes for tagging wardens in announcements, **starting today.**

**Going forward 👇**
- If your Discord account is verified, you will be tagged in announcements for audit awards, bot race results, etc. 
- If you're not yet verified, your C4 username will appear, but you will *not* be tagged. 

Instructions on verifying your Discord account can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1146836596465872916).

**👩‍🍳 On the menu for this week**

- **The $1.1M audit with zkSync:** this one’s so big we needed a list within a list for this bullet point. We’ve seen the level of anticipation surrounding this audit, so we’ve put together a bunch of materials to make onboarding into it as easy as possible.

CALL FOR ISSUES 

The first session of the Supreme Court is currently in session. Supreme Court justices Alex, Trust, and LSDan are reviewing past case law in order to improve guidance for wardens, lookouts, and judges in pursuit of greater consistency in judging.

They have their own lists, but will also be reviewing all open org issues. @🐺Wardens and @🏛Judges are invited to open new issues for the Supreme Court to consider.

Please note that issues should be focused on inconsistencies in judging similar issues or areas where rules and guidance are not clear.

Issues should be presented without personal criticisms and should be included with fact based evidence and linked examples wherever possible.

You can open issues here: https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues

**Announcing Code4rena Team Profiles 🤝**

Since launching Code4rena Warden Profiles, we’ve heard the cries of *“wen team profiles?”*. The answer is today! 

So what does this mean? Several things.

1: **Every team now has its own public profile**, including all the good stuff that is a part of individual Warden Profiles: Names, avatars, relevant tags, metrics bar, historical findings data, leaderboard ranking, project logos, and a findings heatmap. 

2: **Editing capabilities for each member of that team**: To jazz up your team’s profile, any current team member can jump into the ‘My team profile’ settings page. This way, you can collaborate on your team’s public representation just as you would an audit.

3: **The big one - Team audit bookings:** Just as projects are able to book their preferred Wardens for solo audits, now they can do the same thing with their desired team. No more jumping through multiple hoops on multiple different platforms. The C4 team will take care of all of the administrative details so you and your team can focus on what you do best, auditing code. 

Interested to see Team Profiles in action? Check out WatchPug’s (who are 2nd place on C4’s all-time leaderboard) [here](https://code4rena.com/@WatchPug).

You can also read more about Code4rena Team Profiles [here](https://code4rena.co/team-profiles-blog).

**🧑‍⚖️  Supreme Court verdicts, Autumn 2023: post-judging QA**

Code4rena's inaugural Supreme Court session (Autumn 2023) has reached the "post-judging QA" phase. 

Huge thanks to our Supreme Court judges: @Alex The Entreprenerd, @LSDan, and @Trust, who have done an extraordinary job of reviewing C4 "case law" and proposing improvements to rules, judging guidelines, and processes. 

A draft of all Supreme Court verdicts for this session can be viewed in the org repo: 
https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/134

Community members are invited to post comments and questions on that issue.

Edited to add: Post-judging QA will close Friday, 17 November 2023 18:00:00 local time (18:00 UTC).

Update: For 69 minutes on Monday Nov 27th, the [Code4rena Twitter account](https://twitter.com/code4rena) was hijacked via sim swap and used to send a phishing link.

We hold Code4rena to high security standards: we have policies in place requiring 2FA on all staff accounts. Unfortunately, access control for Twitter was missed based on assumptions in our internal review. As a result, the SIM swap provided the attacker sufficient access to take over the account.

We have now regained control of the account, and will be working to perform access control review and enforcing through policy non-SMS 2FA in any and all places we can.

Out of an abundance of caution we have temporarily disabled Login via Wallet Connect due to reports of a potential vulnerability in the login process of the library. We are evaluating susceptibility for code4rena.com with Wallet Connect, and will re-enable the service once we have verified a fix is in place or is not required. We'll post back when we have more information.

@everyone **Update** 

A Ledger library was compromised via a hijacked npm token. :alert: 

We encourage everyone to avoid any interaction with Ledger for the time being while this is being resolved. 

This exploit affects a significant number of dApps due to dynamic CDN loading of the library.

**Update**

A release of the compromised downstream vulnerability, `@ledgerhq/connect-kit` has been fixed. 

In order to mitigate potential future attack vectors we are working on ensuring any dynamic CDN loading from the affected libraries we use is fully removed, prior to re-enabling wallet auth and registration.

Additionally, we have done a preliminary analysis of transactions for the known attacker addresses we are aware of against C4 user addresses and have not yet identified any indication of affected accounts in our system. We will keep you updated as we continue to gather more information on the scope of the attack and any of its relevant impact to C4.

First of a handful of end-of-year housekeeping updates over the next ~week.

We’ve realized that while C4’s certified warden agreement has very clear legal terms for participating in Code4rena, the submission policy has not been as clear for all contributors.

Therefore, the submission policy in the Code4rena docs has been updated and it is now separate from the information about report types and best practices. (For everyone who already is certified, it's basically the same core terms outside of backstage-specific stuff.)

Please don’t hesitate to reach out via a helpdesk request if you have any questions. (code4rena.com/help)

As mentioned earlier today in #📢・c4-updates, we paused wallet-based login and registration on the Code4rena website as a means of risk mitigation against the Ledger library hijack.

Wardens who are already logged in should be unaffected, but new logins with WalletConnect or Metamask will be disabled for the time being.

If you are a current warden, you should be able to login using your password.

Our team is working hard to have wallet-based login available again by tomorrow morning PST. We appreciate your patience in the meantime 🙏🏻

**Update**

The `@ledgerhq/connect-kit` library was compromised on Dec 14th starting at 8:49am UTC. This library is dynamically loaded via another library `@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader` which is used by a significant number of dApps due to their dependency chains.

We became aware of the issue at 12:36pm UTC, and after an initial investigation, as a precaution, we disabled wallet based login at 12:54pm UTC, with registration following at 1:41pm UTC, while we performed an in depth investigation of our susceptibility to the attack. During this time, users were still able to login and register via password.

After performing our investigation, including multiple login and registration tests with Ledger devices, we were able to determine that code4rena applications **were not susceptible to this attack**. Our current libraries do not dynamically load any external JavaScript libraries as part of wallet interactions.

In parallel to our code investigation, we also performed a preliminary analysis of known attacker addresses, cross referencing those with code4rena user wallet addresses, and found no indication C4 user wallet addresses were targeted in the attack.

We will be re-enabling wallet login and registration shortly.

I know everyone has been eagerly awaiting an update on the results of the zkSync competition. I’m sorry that we’ve not been able to be transparent with you all about the nature and cause of our delay.

Based on concerns raised by Matter Labs, staff have been in coordination with the Matter Labs team in efforts to diligently investigate and resolve a sensitive issue which we feel could have significantly impacted the fairness of the competition.

Here’s (judge) Alex’s statement on the topic, which also provides a recap:

> After the end of the zkSync contest, I was asked to review evidence that demonstrates that HE1M was a Matter Labs contractor or someone related to the contractor.
> 
> Personally, I stand by the vast majority of the decisions that I've taken, as I keep in mind the possibility that Wardens and sponsors are lying as part of my judging process.
> 
> After reviewing the evidence, I have to conclude one or both of the following scenarios took place:
> 
> - HE1M was a Matter Labs contractor that purposefully left bugs in the system to gain an unfair advantage
> - HE1M has a relationship with the Matter Labs contractor, who received unfair positive treatment by the Matter Labs contractor. The contractor potentially disclosed inside information not available to other participants.
> 
> Of all the evidence, which I will not mention, I am mostly hurt by the private conversations I've had with the Matter Labs contractor.
> 
> When I shared sensitive information with the Matter Labs contractor, due to his role as a Warden, I was met with an attempt to escalate severities in favour of HE1M.
> 
> This leads me to conclude that the Warden received unfair treatment, which constitutes cheating, and breaks the Warden’s code of conduct.
> 
> Due to the above, I agree with the decision to disqualify the Warden for failure to disclose a clear conflict of interest.
> 
> During the Supreme Court session of 2023, we spent quite some time discussing some more grey area conflicts of interest, such as being a previous auditor or a team member, which can be discussed separately.
> 
> I have no doubt we can all agree that this instance will be viewed as an abuse as well as a failure to disclose a conflict of interest

I would like to ask folks to be professional and to do your best to avoid engaging in Twitter gossip on this topic.

**We will now be working swiftly through the awarding process and will be announcing awards by Tuesday next week.**

Thank you again to the Matter Labs team for being exceptional partners, for your diligence, and for putting the integrity and fairness at the center of resolving this matter.

**Important announcement regarding tax information for Code4rena contributors **

https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/146

tl;dr:

- Getting an easier way for community members to stay in compliance with tax reporting obligations is something we have been asked for from community members for some time.
- Code4rena has tax reporting responsibility as a US entity (and would have even if we remained entityless, which was actually why we formed the entity last year)
- We have created a system and process for enabling tax reporting which also ensures confidentiality and privacy.
- We will soon provide contributors a link to a questionnaire to determining what, if any, U.S. reporting or withholding obligations exist. 
- Based on our obligations to operate within tax regulation, completing that questionnaire will be required by participants in order to receive future awards from competitions.

@🐺Wardens Two important updates re: Uniswap competition

1. Due to some global site availability issues widely reported, we are **extending the Uniswap competitive audit for 24 hours**. 

2. There was confusion regarding the HM pool listed and subsequent edits made by staff. The README is the source of truth. 

A note from @CloudEllie - AWAY 'til 4 Nov on that front:

> I'm deeply sorry for the miscommunication re: award pools for this audit. What you're seeing here is the result of our systems having been built for fixed award pools - and these "accelerating" pool calculations therefore being handled manually, which obviously leads to human error.
> 
> To be clear: the changes shown in the README and RSVP are staff corrections, not sponsor change requests. I take responsibility for the inconsistency and confusion here.
> 
> Historically C4 has treated the audit repo README at launch time as the source of truth; **we will do that here and honor the original HM pool that was listed there ($75,500), regardless of whether Highs and/or Mediums are found.**
> 
> I'm working with staff to standardize our data sources and processes, to ensure this doesn't happen again.

**Appeals process, v1 **

During post-judging QA for the recent UniStaker Infrastructure audit:

- the sponsor team contested the validity and risk of three findings, and
- an anonymous judge submitted an amicus brief, disagreeing with the findings’ validity.

Given the intense debate among these experts in the Code4rena community, C4 staff deemed it appropriate to assemble an Appellate Court (Appeal Committee) to consider the arguments presented. 

A detailed write-up of the process and next steps has been posted in the org repo:

I want to give a personal note of thanks to all @🐺Wardens and @💼Sponsors.

**[Pro League](https://code4rena.com/pro)** is something we've built with an enormous amount of love and passion for better securing the space and creating highly meritocratic opportunities for top talent. It is a result of **you** and the ideas and DMs and input you have shared through the huge wins and challenges we have overcome together in constantly innovating the competitive audit model with your help.

The concepts involved in Pro League—which we'll be sharing over the next few weeks—are based on years of learning and hundreds of conversations with this community of wardens and sponsors. We've been quietly working on iterating the concept for almost a year and there's so much more to come.

We believe Pro League will be the highest quality security consulting in our industry, the fairest and most exciting model, a revolutionary competitive marketplace and esport, and a major step forward for the space as whole especially when it comes to valuing the work of top security talent and creating a powerful path to a career for all wardens.

I have one other not-so-secret secret: @bytes032 officially joined the c4 leadership team earlier this year. He has long been a friend and advisor and I speak for all @🧙‍♀️Staff in saying we are privileged to have been able to collaborate with him and so excited for what's coming next.

Actually—one more thing: @samczsun and @cmichel are joining Pro League exclusive to Code4rena and will be working with me, @CloudEllie - AWAY 'til 4 Nov, @bytes032, @🧺 picnic and a select group of Pro Leaguers to craft and iterate some of the exciting aspects we will be rolling out as part of Pro League.

It is the privilege of my life to be part of creating opportunities for you and for our community as we work together to better secure the space. From the bottom of my heart, thank you thank you for allowing me to be part of this with you all and for your trust in me and the rest of our team.

ℹ️ **Account verification grace period ending**

**tl;dr** If your code4rena.com user account was created before April 18th of this year, you will need to verify your email address and discord by June 10th at 23:59 UTC if you have not already done so, or you will no longer be able to submit to audits. Please check your [account settings](https://code4rena.com/account) to ensure your email address and discord are verified, so your access isn't restricted!

On April 18th we launched our new authentication system. As part of this update we are requiring all users to verify their email addresses and discord accounts. Users who do not complete verification will begin losing access to various systems, including submitting to audits. If you joined after April 18th and have already verified, no action is needed. For those of you who registered prior to April 18th, we set a grace period for your access to not be impacted, but this period ends on June 10th at 23:59 UTC. Even if you previously verified your email in our old system, please check your [account settings](https://code4rena.com/account) to ensure both your email address and discord are verified.

Very happy for everyone who was able to receive $ZK in the zkSync airdrop based on c4 involvement and your other security research endeavors 🙂 

We will not be taking any more support-related questions regarding airdrop as we don't control how they ultimately did their allocation and have no control on any changes. 

We provided a csv of wardens' awards and addresses (which we accompany with MASSIVE kudos to the zksync team as well as empathy for how hard it is to ship something this size without having a small minority wishing the outcome were different in some way!)

I would recommend anyone wanting to keep tabs on any updates related to the airdrop to follow the official Twitter account [@TheZKNation](https://twitter.com/TheZKNation) as it [sounds like they intend to provide answers to questions on the allocation](https://x.com/TheZKNation/status/1801005318622662929)

And please be VERY cautious getting scammed by numerous fake accounts in replies.

Understandably, there are a lot of questions. We will answer them in full transparency and with great detail.

My personal ask is that we as a community send the zksync nothing but super good vibes and support given how impossible it is to do this without a few people yelling at you no matter how good your intentions and how well you execute.

**Validator workflows: what's next**

After weighing the benefits and challenges of the current Validator process, we've decided to make some changes to the Validator role: 

**For audits starting on or after Monday, July 8,** C4's open audits will revert to having a single validator.

**Correcting an error in awarding documentation**

Wardens, I'm very embarrassed to say that I overlooked a key update to our awarding documentation during our rules update in late April. 

When we implemented the [changes](https://code4rena.com/blog/code4rena-spring-update-2024) that included increased HM pools, Validators, and the bonuses for Top Hunter / Top Gatherer, we also adjusted the decrementer for duplicates from 0.9 to 0.85. 

As the person responsible for ensuring that our docs are accurate and up to date, I take full responsibility for this oversight and I apologize for any consternation caused by this belated change and correction. I intended to include this detail in the blog announcement, to give the community advance notice of the change.

The [docs](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards) have been updated and I welcome any questions you may have.

Hey, all -- important update.

[We've said in the past this was coming](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/146), but we’re finally rolling out our tax reporting system.

(I know so many of you have been waiting forever for this, and we want to thank you for your endless patience!)

**For all audits starting this week (including Optimism) everyone will need to provide some basic information before receiving awards.**

We'll share details on the steps required in the next couple weeks, but you can read more in [this earlier discussion thread](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/146). If you have questions on this, feel free to drop them in that discussion.

@everyone :goose: important housekeeping update!

We’ve been sharing this year that to be legally compliant, we need to collect tax reporting information, and noted last month that will be [required for payment for all audits from July 16 on](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1262927328263012414).

**Our system is ready for you to [provide your information here](https://code4rena.com/tax-info) and we encourage you to do that now so you can keep receiving awards in a timely manner.**

We take being entrusted with your privacy and personal information very seriously. As such: 

- This info is submitted via an end-to-end encrypted transmission to isolated data storage separate from the rest of our API.
- There is extremely restricted access to the key.
- The sole use of provided information is to ensure OFAC compliance and enable accountants (under NDA) to submit annual tax reports.
- The only other cases data could be accessed would be under legal subpoena or due to justified inquiries based on compelling evidence of grave ethical violations.

Thank you!

Hi, everyone! We have a big announcement today that we're excited about. 

Code4rena is joining Zellic.

Most important of all for our community: we're staying independent and committed to the same values: same leadership team (I'm still CEO Sock) and same staff.

I wrote a thread here particularly for you all which I hope you'll read:

https://x.com/sockdrawermoney/status/1826621260505510242

I'm going to also open a thread in #❓・questions and folks can feel free to ask anything you'd like there!

Oh, one more thing. We're renaming Pro League to Zenith. 

We’re going to do a bigger push on this in the future, but we’re sharing a heads up with you all before we do that.

Why?

“Pro League” was fine internally but hard to get traction in explaining to folks outside of C4 lore. And ultimately, Zenith is about serving customers with top talent on demand and getting top performing C4 folks paid opportunities on private audits and competitive audit side pools.

Zenith is still fully C4 (the Z is just a fun coincidence with Zellic)

But, from our perspective, Zenith is a great term for this.

Definition of _zenith_: 

1. the time at which something is most powerful or successful.
2. the highest point reached by a celestial or other object.

So as a warden, if you make it to Zenith, you’re a powerful, successful star  💫

And if, as a customer, you want to book the powerful, successful stars of Code4rena on private engagements or have them participate in sidepools, the zenith of the C4 leaderboard is exactly who you want.

So: long live the SRs and ZRs of Code4rena!

[09/20/2024 22:51] sockdrawermoney (pinned)
Today we are introducing the **Audit Catalyst**, a new optional feature of competitive audits designed to transfer advanced understanding from prior auditors to wardens. Its purpose is to accelerate onboarding and enhance Code4rena’s effectiveness in securing the code.

## Background:

One of the chronic inefficiencies in the security industry that Code4rena aims to solve is the siloing of security insight and knowledge. From day one, our intent was to make all results open. Today, Code4rena hosts the largest collection of web3 vulnerabilities alongside the original audited code, contributing to a continuous cycle of auditor improvement and industry-wide security enhancement.

But we believe that contextual security knowledge on a project-by-project basis still has a long way to go.

Unless a team has designated security experts to facilitate this transfer, most valuable insights remain untapped as code moves from auditor to auditor. Trying to reassemble auditors' understanding through their audit report is like trying to navigate a complex maze with only a snapshot of the exit.

## Introducing the Audit Catalyst

An Audit Catalyst includes a well organized collection of intel and insight:

- Fundamentals of auditing this type of project
- Project architecture, design, and operational overview
- Detailed threat models for the project
- Hot spots in the codebase, including prior auditors' "what I'd focus on if I had more time" wishlist
- Any additional internal notes from prior auditors' work

## Compensation

In the future, Audit Catalysts will receive 3-10% from the pool based on the quality and level of value contributed. We will be developing a rubric and an assessment model for these. (For the first several Catalysts, the full 10% will be allocated based on the additional work needed for helping to iterate the model.)

Prior auditors (preferably the immediately prior auditor) can reach out to Code4rena in order to coordinate a Catalyst submission for a competition. (These are selected individually and must be approved prior to scheduling the competition.)

The first Code4rena competitive audit with a Catalyst will be the upcoming Kakarot audit.

This Catalyst model is something we have long wanted to put into place, but through our relationship with the Zellic team, we have been able to develop it for trial. In fact, part of the appeal in joining forces with Zellic has been the way they use and document threat models as a part of their engagements and the considerable depth of quality in their written guides.

We’re excited to work with the community on continuing to develop and improve the Audit Catalyst model and using it to better enhance the effectiveness of competitive audits.

# Rolling triage trial

I’m excited about a new feature we’ll be rolling out for the upcoming #🏛ramses-oct8 competition that we call _**rolling triage**_.

Here’s the tl;dr of how it works from the warden perspective:

- a multi-week audit is divided into phases
- submissions for a phase close, then get opened for the next phase
- submitting a finding makes that finding ‘known’ in later phases and ineligible, incentivizing early submission
- everyone participating can see the prior week’s findings
- the base finding value increases each week, so we can ensure bugs that take more depth of understanding, time, and effort will get paid considerably more

A little background on the topic...

## “Live submissions” and other security vulnerabilities

For years, sponsors have requested access to findings during a competition.

But the competitive audit model depends on algorithmically assessing the value of an individual’s contribution by the rarity of their submissions among all other participants.

So we’ve always responded: “No, giving access to live submissions breaks the competitive model and risks harming the highest value contributors the most as it introduces serious attack vectors.”

Even if you presume all sponsors are upstanding citizens who would never attempt to use privileged access to steal from wardens by duplicating findings, we know from experience that sponsors themselves are not monolithic entities:

- ZachXBT’s past research has identified multiple DeFi projects (including past Code4rena customers) were infiltrated by DPRK developers.
- We had a rather infamous incident where a member of the sponsor dev team used privileged access from a private live critical disclosure in order to duplicate the original reporter’s highly valuable finding.

And, moreover, we know that the most experienced competitive auditors wait until the end to submit _anyway_ because of their understanding of the risks that access poses, so the benefit to customers is minimal.

While we haven’t seen a lot of clear documented instances of abuse across the industry, I believe this is because this kind of access has been rare until recently because security platforms have accepted this as a real tradeoff.

But the market has forced this question to the surface and customers have choices and I am 1000% empathetic to developers wanting access to findings earlier.

## Looking forward to hearing about your thoughts and experience with this

There are tradeoffs involved in this approach, but we believe these are the right ones in accelerating access to findings without compromising the integrity or the length of an audit. This is a model we conceived of a LONG time ago. We’re going to give it a shot with Ramses and we’ll see what we learn together.

I have a lot more thoughts I’d like to share on the topic and we’ll have more detail coming in terms of the practicals, but I’m going to sign off for now 😄

We will be interested to hear your thoughts!
